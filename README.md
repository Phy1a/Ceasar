# Ceasar

Welcome to my first code, this project is about encrypt and decrypt texts using CÃ©sar's method. It was my first project ever so the the v1 is mad with truly horrendous code, that's why i needed to redo it, hense the v2.

Just compile and run the files just like any Python files.

## Disclamer : the texts in terminal are in french
